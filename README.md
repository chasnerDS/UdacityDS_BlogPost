1. What are the Key Factors Influencing House Prices in California?
Objective: Identify and analyze the most significant features that influence house prices in California.
Approach:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the relationships between features and the target variable (house prices).
Use correlation analysis to find which features have the strongest relationships with house prices.
Apply feature importance techniques from models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to rank the features based on their influence on the target variable.
2. How Does the Geographic Location Affect House Prices in Different Regions of California?
Objective: Investigate how house prices vary across different regions in California and understand the impact of geographic location.
Approach:
Use geospatial data visualization techniques (e.g., plotting data on a map) to identify regional price differences.
Group the data by different regions (e.g., counties, zip codes) and compare average house prices.
Analyze the impact of location-related features (latitude and longitude) on house prices using regression models.
3. Can We Predict House Prices Accurately Using a Regression Model?
Objective: Build and evaluate a regression model to predict house prices based on the available features.
Approach:
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and evaluate their performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the chosen model.
Analyze the model's performance and interpret the results to understand the strengths and limitations of your predictive model.
